\title{Non-stationary Time Series}

\section{The Big Picture on Time Series}

I have to say it takes me a while to grasp the gist of \textit{time series}. Fortunately, I got the big picture, which can be the contour for doing empirical research in macroeconomics. For most students, the starting point of learning time series is the stationary process like AR(1) or MA(1). However, later I realised that lots of time series from real world are not stationary, which make researchers' life difficult and fun. So, what's the big picture of time series? Here we go: at this moment, it's about data-generating process for me.

Follow the idea by \cite{campbell1991pitfalls}, we assume that a time series $\{y_t\}$ is a realization of a deterministic trend and a stochastic component:
\begin{align}
  y_t = TD_t + z_t,
\end{align}
where $TD_t$ assigns a deterministic trend, which can be assumed to have the linear trend, $TD_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2 t$, and $z_t$ represents the stochastic compoment $\phi(L)z_t = \theta(L) \varepsilon_t$ with $\varepsilon_t \sim$i.i.d. Or expand it out, we have:
\begin{align*}
  y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + z_t; \ \ \ \ \ \phi(L)z_t = \theta(L) \varepsilon_t \ \ \varepsilon_t \sim i.i.d
\end{align*}

The intuition behind this assumption can be summarised by the following table:
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
  \title{Summary of data-generating process}
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \hline
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Deterministic Trend}} & \textbf{Stochastic Component} \\
    \hline
    Fixed effects & Trend & Stochastic pattern with random shocks \\
    \hline
    $\beta_1$ & $\beta_2 t$ & $\phi(L)z_t = \theta(L) \varepsilon_t$ \\
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Reflects Human Being's determination} & Law of nature (or unknown process) \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For the deterministic trend, things are easy as we can predict it very well if they really follow a certain trend, which is highly unlikely in real data sets. It is common sense that everything is changing. Therefore, we care more about the stochastic part\footnote{or random part, think about normal distribution phenomena, then you will realise this part is the key.}.

Now, if all roots of the autoregressive polynomial lie outside the unit circle, then $\{y_t\}$ is stationary around a deterministic trend. In this case, one could remove the trend from the original series $\{y_t\}$ and fit an ARMA(p, q) to the residuals. In R programming, you can do it like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
  # Detrend the time series
  detrended <- residuals(lm(y ~ seq(along = y)))
  # fit ARMA model
  arma <- arima(detrend, ma=..., ar=...,)
\end{lstlisting}

The \textit{trend-stationary} model is also called the integrated model of order zero or $I(0)$. But, what if some roots lie on the unit circle\footnote{we don't consider the cases that roots are inside the unit circle as $y_t$ will explore in this case.}? If it happens, things become tricky and that's why I am writing this notes now. For the unit root situation, $\Delta z_t = (1-L) z_t$ is stationary around a constant mean, the series $\{y_t\}$ is \textit{difference-stationary} because one has to apply the first difference filter with respect to time to obtain a stationary process. This process can be analyzed with \textit{autoregressive integrated moving average} (ARIMA)(p, d, q), where d refers to the order of intergration.

\textbf{Take away}: by decomposing time series $\{y_t\}$, we realise that stochastic part is the key, and unit root situation is the aiming ring.

Before we moving to the next section, let's state the distinction between a trend- and a difference-stationary process by giving the following two processes:
\begin{align}
  y_t  & = y_{t-1} + \mu = y_0 + \mu t \\
  y_t & = y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t = y_0 + \sum_{s=1}^t \varepsilon_s
\end{align}

\section{Unit Root Processes}

As we have said that unit root processes are so important, it's worth to devote ourselves to this topic. Let's review the data-generating process:
\begin{align}
  y_t & = y_0 + \mu t + z_t \\
      & = y_0 + \mu t + (\phi(L) z_t = \theta(L) \varepsilon_t)
\end{align}
Now, let's decompose the stochastic component $z_t$ into a cyclical component $c_t$ and a stochastic trend $TS_t$. It is assumed that \textit{cyclical component} $c_t$ is a mean-stationary process. Then, equation (2.1) can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
  y_t = y_0 + \mu t + c_t + TS_t
\end{align}

Equation (2.3) will be the \textbf{key function} for almost all our analysis in this document. Now, let's list all situations for $y_t$ in equation (2.3):
\begin{itemize}
  \item If $y_t$ is trend stationary, then the stochastic trend ($TS_t$) is zero. Then, $y_t$ can be modeled by ARMA(p, q).
  \item If $y_t$ is difference stationary, then the autoregressive polynomial contains a unit root that can be factored out by doing the difference, $\phi(L) = (1- L)\phi^{*}(L)$. After doing the difference, we get $\Delta z_t$ which can be modeled as the moving average process.
\end{itemize}

Now, if we represent $z_t = TS_t + c_t = \psi(1) S_t + \psi^{*}(L) \varepsilon_t$, where $\psi(1)$ is the sum of moving average coefficients and $S_t$ is the sume of the past and present of random shocks $\sum_{s=1}^t \varepsilon_s$, and $\psi^{*}(L)$ is the polynomial coefficients. The full equation is\footnote{Check equation (1.3), to see what's going on.}:
\begin{align}
  z_t = c_t + TS_t = \psi(1) \sum_{s=1}^t \varepsilon_s + \frac{\psi(L) - \psi(1)}{(1 - L)} \varepsilon_t
\end{align}

Final step, substitute (2.4) into (2.3) to get:
\begin{align}
  y_t & = y_0 + \mu t + TS_t + c_t \\
      & = y_0 + \mu t + \psi(1) \sum_{s=1}^t \varepsilon_s + \frac{\psi(L) - \psi(1)}{(1 - L)} \varepsilon_t
\end{align}

I am sorry to reclaim that equation (2.6) will be the \textbf{key function} for almost all our analysis of time series data. The intuition and summary on (2.6) is given in Figure 2.2.
